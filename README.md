## Access Tokens and Authentication

You can generate an access token if you have a GitHub account by following the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

If you're using `Tokens (classic)` the only permission you'll need is `public_repo` under `repo`. If you want to be able to access provide repos you should tick `repo` to select the entire tree.
